Address Book Management System (C Project)

A fully functional console-based Address Book application written in C, designed with modular architecture, file storage, sorting features, and a clean ANSI-colored interface.
This project demonstrates real-world usage of structures, pointers, file handling, sorting algorithms, and modular programming.

🚀 Features
* ➕ Create Contact
* 🔍 Search Contact
* ✏️ Edit Contact
* 🗑️ Delete Contact
* 📋 List Contacts with sorting by:
  * Name
  * Phone
  * Email
* 💾 Persistent storage using file handling
* 🎨 Colored terminal UIfor better readability

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* Developed entirely in **C 
* Modular structure (`contact.h`, multiple .c files)
* Robust input validation
* Custom sorting implementation
* File operations using `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fprintf`, etc.
* User-friendly command-line interface
  
## 💡 **What I Learned**
* Designing modular and scalable C applications
* Practical usage of structures and pointers
* Implementing persistent storage
* Writing clean, maintainable code
* Building terminal UIs with ANSI color codes
